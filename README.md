# typescript-csv-reader
A simple CSV reader built in node.js using TypeScript

A small application built in node using typescript that explores a composition based approach to creating a CSV reader that can output an HTML file analysis of data.  Object composition refers to the design pattern of referencing class instances in other classes to abtract out various functionality.  This approach is different from inhertance, which would make use of abstract classes and prototypal inheritance.
